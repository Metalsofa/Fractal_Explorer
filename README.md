# Fractal_Explorer
OpenGL-based application for exploring Mandelbrot, Julia, and other fractals
The controls are currently very simple:

Use left-click to pan around the image,

Use right-click to alter the fractal parameter (if the current fractal requires one)

Press `c` to go to the next colorscheme, or `shift+C` to go to the previous one

Press `m` to go to the next fractal, or `shift+M` to go to the previous one

The fractals are defined in the Shaders folder. You can modify the GLSL shader code to make your own fractals
